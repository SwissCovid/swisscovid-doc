<h1>SwissCovid Check-in with CrowdNotifier</h1>

## CrowdNotifier
CrowdNotifier proposes a protocol for building secure, decentralized, privacy-preserving presence tracing systems. It simplifies and accelerates the process of notifying individuals that shared a semi-public location with a SARS-CoV-2-positive person for a prolonged time without introducing new risks for users and locations. Existing proximity tracing systems (apps for contact tracing such as SwissCovid, Corona Warn App, and Immuni) notify only a subset of these people: those that were close enough for long enough. Current events have shown the need to notify all people that shared a space with a SARS-CoV-2-positive person. The proposed system provides an alternative to other presence-tracing systems that are based on invasive collection or that are prone to abuse by authorities.

The CrowdNotifier design aims to minimize privacy and security risks for individuals and communities, while guaranteeing the highest level of data protection and good usability and deployability. For further details on the design, see the [CrowdNotifier technical specification](https://crowdnotifier.readthedocs.io/).
