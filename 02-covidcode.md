<h1>SwissCovid Covidcode</h1>

Users that test positive for COVID-19 receive a Covidcode. The responsible health ageny that tested the user positive can use the [CovidCode UI](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCode-UI) to generate this code. If users do not receive this code in time, they can also request a code by calling the hotline number provided in the app. The COVID-positive user enters this Covidcode into the SwissCovid app. The app validates the code to retrieve two authentication tokens at the [CovidCode Service](https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCode-service), and then uploads the userâ€™s TEKs for the proximity tracing to the SwissCovid red backend together with one of the authentication tokens as well as the list of check-ins to the SwissCovid purple backend together with one of the authentication tokens.
