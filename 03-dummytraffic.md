<h1>SwissCovid Dummy traffic</h1>

Adversaries that can observe network communication can observe network traffic between a userâ€™s smartphone and the backend server or servers. Powerful network adversaries might also be able to observe network traffic between backends. Network adversaries can use these observations to try to infer sensitive information about users: whether they received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, or whether they received a notification of exposure to COVID-19 positive users.

To prevent this possibility to infer information about the users health from the network traffic, the SwissCovid app periodically sends out dummy (fake) requests that look like actual requests. A detailed description and analysis of this dummy traffic can be found in the [DP3T documents](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20-%20Best%20Practices%20for%20Operation%20Security%20in%20Proximity%20Tracing.pdf).

With the addition of presence tracing in SwissCovid 2.0 there is an additional delay after entering the Covidcode where the user can select the events to share. Because there are requests before and after this user interaction this delay is visible in the network traffic. The SwissCovid app make sure that this delay is always a multiple of 5s by adding an additional delay after the user interaction. Also in the dummy traffic a delay of a multiple of 5s is added. The distribution of the actual delays of the user interaction can be learned in the purple backend as for every true upload the duration of the user interaction is uploaded. From this data the logic for the random delays can be refined over time to get the same delay distribution in the dummy traffic as in the real traffic.
